# Local Land Charges - Schema for 'Bulk-Load' Import File

This repository contains the following:
* A Draft04 JSON Schema describing the input file for the LLC bulk-load program.
* A JSON schema showing the mapping between the Charge types, sub categories and instruments (validation of this mapping has been removed from the v5.0 schema and is now performed separately)
* A list of statutory provisions

During the Beta phase of Local Land Charges, these schemas could be subject to change.

**The list of statutory provisons found in ```statutory_provisions.txt``` may not be the most up to date version.**

Please find an up to date copy of the Statutory Provisions here:
